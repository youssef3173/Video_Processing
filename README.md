# Video processing: Block motion estimation using Full and Diamond Search

Block-matching is the most popular technique for motion estimation /compensation in video coding standards. Full search (FS) is the most accurate and simple technique in block-matching algorithms (BMAs).

Diamond search makes use of the center-biased motion characteristics of video sequences and uses diamond search patterns instead of rectangular as most of other search methods.
